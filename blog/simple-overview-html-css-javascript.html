    <h1>A simple overview of HTML vs CSS vs JavaScript</h1>
            <p>
                HTML, CSS & JavaScript are programming languages which are together used to create structured,
                good looking and interactive websites. Here's a simple overview of what each language is used for 
                in the context of creating websites.
            </p>
        <h2>HTML</h2>
            <p>
                HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is used for creating a structure for the website. This helps us create the fundamental building blocks for 
                the website which can later by styled and enhanced. There are HTML elements that can be used to add different types 
                of content to the webpage like text, images, lists, links, etc.
            </p>
            <strong>
                Note: HyperText means text that can be linked to different parts of the page or other pages.
            </strong>
        <h2>CSS</h2>
            <p>
                CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is used for styling the HTML elements of the website. It can be used to add colors, change font size, font weight, 
                layout of the webpage, position of elements on the page and can even be used to make the site responsive (properly formatted) 
                for different screen sizes and devices.
            </p>
        <h2>JavaScript</h2>
            <p>
                JavaScript can be used to add behaviour to the HTML elements and also to dynamically (changing content based on actions performed) load HTML 
                and CSS on to the webpage. It can be used to add different interactive behaviours that could be used to make the HTML elements perform wide 
                range of actions like loading text when a button is clicked, asking for confirmation when deleting something on the page, displaying form 
                data on the page, etc. JavaScript is what makes the modern websites 'modern' and made possible to build web applications.
