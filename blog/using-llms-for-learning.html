            LLM - Large Language Model
        </p>
        <p>I've recently come across a blog post (cited below) from Josh Comeau in which he 
            wrote about a strategy to follow when using LLMs like ChatGPT for learning new things, 
            especially programming.
        </p>
        <p>
            It's a good strategy, so I decided to re-share it by adding a few of my own thoughts.
        </p>
        <p>
            I tried learning programming on and off for a few years now. Every time, I start, get somewhere, 
            and abandon the process for some reason. This year though, I had to learn it cos I decided to pursue a Master's in Computer Science 
            and it's a strong requirement for me. I love coding, but the learning process can get gruesome at times. One of the hard things 
            is getting an understanding of how things work at a high level. Sure, almost everyone has an idea of what a website is and how it works, but 
            what about the process of building that. That's what a programmer needs to get a grasp of to build a website or web application. And this is 
            what ChatGPT helped me understand with ease. 
        </p>
        <p>
            I had an idea for a simple web app a few months back, and I wanted to see how far I could get with just ChatGPT. 
            After two days and two nights of work, I built a close enough version of the app I wanted to build and deployed it on to heroku. 
            And that was the first time I ever built a web app that could actually be used by someone other than me. There were and are 
            still a lot of things that I don't understand about how the web app works but it helped me get an overview understanding of the process, the frameworks involved, 
            how a model-view-controller framework works, how I can style front-end using TailWind, etc.
        </p>
        <p>
            I jumped into something without having much clarity over it and I still don't have complete clarity over it. And that's okay, cos now I'm learning, 
            I'm learning how things work at a low-level based on my understanding of how things work at a high-level. I'm able to keep up much better with my 
            learning process cos I got an understanding of how things work in general.
        </p>
        <p>
            Now, pointing back to the reason I wanted to write about this, ChatGPT and other LLMs like that, while they can help you in your learning, they can also make you lazy and point you in a wrong direction. 
            If you truly want to learn something, you have to put in the effort to understand how things work at a low level, there is no other way. ChatGPT is not a quick or easy solution for that process. Josh Comeau provides a good strategy in his 
            article about 'The End of Front-End Development' from the point of view of rise in LLMs. 
        </p>
        <p>
            The following is an excerpt taken from his article.

            <h3>Using LLMs to help you learn</h3>
            <p>
                I've heard from a few folks who have said that ChatGPT has been really helpful when it comes to learning technical skills. If you're confused by something in a tutorial, you can ask the AI to explain it to you!
            </p>
            <p>
                This is a really interesting use case to me. Essentially, ChatGPT is like a pair programmer, someone who can help you make sense of things you don't understand. You can ask it specific questions and get specific answers. 
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>But I do think you need to be careful.</b> There's a right way and a wrong way to use tools like this to help you learn.
            </p>
            <p>
                The wrong way would be to treat it like GPS navigation. When I have to drive somewhere, I pop the address into my GPS, and follow its instructions indiscriminately. I do generally wind up where I need to go, but it requires 0 mental effort on my part. As a result, my sense of direction has totally atrophied. I can't go anywhere now without a synthesized voice telling me what to do. ðŸ˜¬
            </p>
            <p>
                Instead of treating it like a GPS, I'd suggest treating it like you're a member of a jury, and the LLM is the defendant, taking the stand. 
            </p>
            <p>
                You'll listen to what they have to say, but you won't accept it as fact. You'll be skeptical, and think critically about every word.
            </p>
            <p>
                Instead of blindly copy/pasting the code that ChatGPT generates, go through it line-by-line, and make sure you understand. Ask it for clarification. And double-check things that seem suspicious with an authoritative source (eg. the official documentation). Keep in mind that LLMs are 100% confident, but not 100% accurate.
            </p>
            <p>
                If you follow this strategy, I think LLMs can offer a lot of value. ðŸ˜„
